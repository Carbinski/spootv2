    <p>Why this website is the greatest thing ever created:</p>
    <p>Now, when you look at this website, you may be thinking something along the lines of this: "Wow! My eyes are bleeding!" or "Isn't this website literally useless?"
        
        And the truth is, it is useless. But what it represents is greater than the sum of its parts. In April of 1970, the Apollo 13 Mission was scheduled to be launched.
        
        This mission was intended to go to the moon, but the oxygen tank failed two days into the mission. Despite being thousands of miles away from earth and stuck in a 
        
        non functional tin can surrounded by the endless cosmos, the three crewmembers on the mission survived and made it back to earth. Although this mission didn't make
        
        it to the moon, it stands a testament to the human spirit. Just like these cosmonauts, about 10 hours ago, as of writing this, I set out on a mission to make the
        
        an amazing program for this hackathon. It was going to be a program that recorded one's spotify listening data and used it to calculate a score for each song, based
        
        on how long it was listened to. Then it would rank each song in a ladder, thus creating a new playlist that plays each song based on how much one enjoyed listening 
        
        to it. But, just like the Astronauts that wanted to go to the moon, this didn't pan out. Turns out the Spotify API that is most suited to doing what I want it to works 
        
        with HTML, a language (I don't even know if HTML is even considered a language) that a knew nothing about. Yet against all odds, I pushed forwards, creating a Program
        
        that could play music from spotify (with like three additional steps) and time how long you listen to each song. So I essentially got halfway there, just like how the
        
        Apollo 13 mission made it halfway to the moon. So essentially what I'm saying is that my hackathon project is garbage, but it is also great because it represents human
        
        willpower and the ability to overcome all odds. Thank you for actually reading this and I hope you have a good day.
